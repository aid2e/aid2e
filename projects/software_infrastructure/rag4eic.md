# RAG4EIC

## Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for the Electron Ion Collider providing AI-powered documentation search and summarization.

## Description
RAG4EIC is an intelligent chatbot system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to help researchers navigate the extensive EIC documentation. The system combines advanced natural language processing with a comprehensive knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware responses to questions about the Electron Ion Collider.

## Key Features
- AI-powered question answering about EIC documentation
- Context-aware responses using RAG technology
- Integration with EIC knowledge base
- Web-based interface for easy access
